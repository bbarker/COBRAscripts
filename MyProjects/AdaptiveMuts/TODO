### Testing G x G accuracy ###
Add weights to FALCON, and a script to do a binary search (or golden
section) to find the appropriate weight to get a paritcular flux
(biomass) value.

Finish the makeKishonyDeLunaModel.m script.

Test DeLuna single mutant fitnesses, then epistasis, against
FALCON-predicted values.
----------------------------------------------

Try original method with FALCON-estimated flux vector.
