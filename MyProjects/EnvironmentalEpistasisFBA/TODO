1) Simulate more conditions

Rev1: - variations of WT growth rate for each condition
      - variations of mutational severity (did we do this)?

Rev2: basically the same
  

Can we do any sort of random samply approach, or cite our previous paper?

Three alternatives:
1) Extesnive sampling across a subset of genes
2) Random sampling of gene pairs (exclude those without any known epistasis),
   WT level, and mutation level (same for both pairs?).
   - Won't sample all 16 conditions for a single gene, but will cover most genes.
   - How to use for stable versus dynamic epistasis? - Just see how 
     stable epistasis (sign?) is across various percentages. We can also cite
     our previous paper, which shows that only extremely deleterious mutations
     tend to cause a strong change in the percentage of epistasis (might be the
     unpublished figure - which we tried to include in the PLOS CB revision).
   - Can still get an idea of mean and variance of differential epistasis 
     for each gene. 
   - Similar to adaptive epistasis code (may be good to integrate).
