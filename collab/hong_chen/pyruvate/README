Note that some of the hardcoded rxn indices may change depending on
COBRA "version" used (or the model if different from iMM904), best to
check they are correct first.

If this needs to be done, look for all reactions of the appropriate
metabolites, e.g., for pyruvate:
find(strcmp(mmIrr.metNames, 'Pyruvate'))
mmIrr.mets(find(strcmp(mmIrr.metNames, 'Pyruvate')))


Alternatively, do all this automatically by correcting for duplicates
and detecting exchange/transport reactions.

---------------------------------------------------------------


Usual commands to run:

%Need this for conversion to irreversible:
pexc = find(strcmp(mm.rxnNames, 'Pyruvate exchange'))
mm.lb(pexc) = -28;
mmIrr = convertToIrreversible(mm);

[pdc, biomvec, eth] = SSPyruvateAll(mmIrr, 727, 0.1, 20, 0.3);
[pdc, biomvec, eth] = SSPyruvateAll(mmIrr, 797, 0.1, 28, 0.3);

Fraction of pyruvate flux to ethanol = 

     (2)                

  PDC Flux             ADH Flux
----------------- * ---------------------   
Pyruvate Produced   (ADH Flux  + ALD Flux) 

(need to verify these rxns (i.e. that there aren't any other 
acetaldehyde producing rxns) and account for compartments)
